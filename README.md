# Open Source Gratitude Buttons

Here is the scenario: you have freely given your time to a free or open source project, you could have spent that time with your family or getting paid real money to for the work you do.  Instead you selflessly built something for someone else to use, it's your users love your work and they want to give something back to you - fortunately this is easy!  A range of "micro-payment" or gratuity services have popped up recently allowing you to accept small donations towards your next cup of coffee - we're never going to get rich from these but waking up to &pound;1/&euro;1/&dollar;1 is recognition that the work you do has real value.

Still not convinced? Isaac Z. Schlueter, the developer of `npm` has written a far deeper analysis of the [current open source monetization landscape][8cc429c0].  One final question to consider that may tip you over the edge: would Heartbleed have ever happened if the developers of OpenSSL had felt more valued?

# Usage and Instructions

This repository contains a small selection of buttons for you to use in your project pages.  They were borne out of my frustration at the lack of a standard style of buttons to host on my own pages.  Because I believe in the Open Source and Creative Commons community I have licenced these under the [Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Public Domain Dedication][f55741c1].

  [f55741c1]: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ "CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)"

I currently only support [Gratipay][90ed3154] and [Flattr][e2eed536] as these are the services I use for my own work.  You can use the GitHub flavoured markdown below to embed the images in your own `README.md` file, paste in the markup and __remember to change the URLs to your own usernames__.

## Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs)

[Scalable Vector Graphics][48aae250] are the smallest file size that will have the lowest impact on your page load times; it is for this reason that using SVG images is the recommended way to include these buttons in your repository. As they are vector images users are able to increase and decrease browser zoom level without losing any image quality.  The only drawback of SVGs is Internet Explorer 8 [does not support][531197f4] the SVG standard.

## Portable Network Graphics

[Portable Network Graphics][b49c66cf] are an image format that has the maximum support across all modern browsers.  They are a type of raster image, which forces browsers to up-scale images when the user zooms in on a page resulting an a noticeable loss of quality.  These images are exported from the SVG files available above so they should be identical in every way at their natural resolutions.

### Super-size Buttons

If you want really big buttons, then you can use the double size icons to really stand out.

# Contributing

I welcome contributions in the form of Pull Requests or just [messages via gitter][80eaa6f5].  There are three primary ways of contributing to these buttons:

  [80eaa6f5]: https://gitter.im/RichardSlater/open-source-gratitude-buttons "Gitter: RichardSlater/open-source-gratitude-buttons"

  1. **Building Buttons** - by adding more buttons to the repository we can support a wider range of services, the one rule is all icons must be submitted under the Creative Commons 1.0 Zero licence to allow anyone to use them freely.
  2. **Adding Translations** - but adding translations in different languages we reduce the barriers to entry on projects that target non-English speaking audiences.
  3. **Adding Services** - I've started small based upon the gratuity services that I currently use, however there are a large number of services out there.  If you use one and can explain it to me let me know and I will add it to the list.

## Building Buttons

These buttons are designed specifically to fit within a [flat design][24931594], even more specifically they are designed using a particular style of flat design called [long shadow][6042ae29] which adds a subtle definition to an otherwise flat design.

  [6042ae29]: http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/long-shadow-design/ "Long Shadow Design â€“ A New Trend? by Thoriq Firdaus"

Fortunately creating these images using the free and open-source software: [Inkscape][c0ac0df8].  If you are more comfortable using another software package such as Adobe Illustrator and are able to export the images in SVG format then please feel free to contribute in that way.

### Step by Step Instructions - __Inkscape 0.91__

To complete this guide you will need to [download Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/en/download/) version 0.91 or later, in addition you will need to download the [Quicksand Font by Andrew Paglinawan](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/quicksand) and a tool to optimize PNG images such as [PNG Gauntlet](http://pnggauntlet.com/).

#### __Step 1:__ Open the Template

A very basic template is available in the `/icons` folder named `original-template.svg` this provides the correct dimensions and background colour to base all buttons from.  First load this template in Inkscape and enable guides by pressing <kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>|</kbd> (Shift and the Pipe Character).

![Figure 1.](assets/README-figure1.png)

With the guides enabled you can see the image is broken down into several regions:

![Figure 2.](assets/README-figure2.png)

 - __Red Zone__: the padding around the outside of the button allows the content of the button to "breathe", this is a no-go zone for anything except the button background and the long shadow.
 - __Yellow Zone__: the icon, this should be a pure white version of the icon if at all possible.  If the terms of use stipulate that colour must be used then we must comply.
 - __Blue Zone__: the text area, this should be in the previously mentioned Quicksand Font.  The blue area depicted above represents the [X-height][477492d0] of Quicksand Book size 11, the actual text will ascend above and below the blue area.

  [477492d0]: http://www.typographydeconstructed.com/x-height/ "Type Glossary: X-Height"

#### __Step 2:__ Add an Icon

Ideally we would stick to a pure white (`#FFFFFF`) images, however if the terms of use of a particular service prevent us from removing colour from an image then we must comply with these requirements.  Images included within the files must be vector images, it is often possible to find SVG versions of logos through media kits or Wikipedia.  Not all logos will fit in within the allocated space however attempt to fit the logo to the height of the Yellow Zone:

![Figure 3.](assets/README-figure3.png)

Once you are comfortable with the position of the logo you can ungroup the object with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>U</kbd> and unify it into a single path with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>+</kbd>.

#### __Step 3:__ Add Text

## Other Ways to Contribute

Don't feel limited by the options above, if you can contribute advice on user experience, colour theory, button design or any technique that allows individual contributors to get recognition for their work then get in contact through the GitHub Issues section or through Gitter - I'm always open to learn and improve on these icons.
